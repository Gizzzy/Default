      <h1 class="top">Who's behind happy hues</h1>
      <p>
        Hi there, My name is Mckenzie child, I'm the maker of Happy hues. One of
        my favorite things ot do is launch fun, useful and sometimes silly
        side-projects that I think should exist outside my head:) My goal with
        Happy Hues was to try to remove the issue where you know you like a
        color palette, but you're unsure about how to appy it to your design or
        illustration. I built this site to not only give yu color inspiration,
        but also gie you an example as to how and where you could use the
        colors.
      </p>

      <h1>White color</h1>
      <p>
        White is the blank canvas color that has all sorts of meanings to it.
        It's connected to cleanliness, virtue, purity, innocence... In North
        American cultures that is. In other parts of the world it can have an
        opposite meaning. White pairs great with basically any color on the
        spectrum. It has high contrast with pretty much all other colors and
        allows other colors to shine through, so it's a great choice for
        background colors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Purple thinks it's better than all the other peasant colors. Lol, jk ;)
        Purple just has a history of being the color of superiority, being used
        by royalty to flaunt their position & power. It's associated with power,
        nobility, prestige & luxury. Purple can fall on both the warm and the
        cool side of the color wheel depending on how much red vs blue is added.

        <h3>Red</h3>
        <p>
          Red is a very emotionally & visually intense color that can actually
          have a physical effect on people by raising their metabolism,
          respiration, heart rate, as well as making them hungry. That combined by
          with the fact that red is very attention grabbing, you see red used in
          the branding of pretty much all fast food chains.

      <div class="card">
        <h3 class="top">Blue</h3>
        <p>
          Blue is a very calming color and can actually slow your metabolism
          (notice how there's little to no food brands that use blue in their
          branding). It's a broadly appealing color, which is why global
          companies like Facebook & Twitter use it for their logos. Although it
          is a broadly appealing color, it tends to be favored by men, with over
          50% of men studied saying blue was their favorite color.

      <div class="tone card">
        <h3 class="top">Tone</h3>
        <p>
          A tone is in between a tint and a shade. Basically you're adding grey,
          aka both white & black, to your hue.
