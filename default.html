    <h1>Who's behind happy hues</h1>
    <p>
      Hi there, My name is Mckenzie child, I'm the maker of Happy hues. One of
      my favorite things ot do is launch fun, useful and sometimes silly
      side-projects that I think should exist outside my head:) My goal with
      Happy Hues was to try to remove the issue where you know you like a color
      palette, but you're unsure about how to appy it to your design or
      illustration. I built this site to not only give yu color inspiration, but
      also gie you an example as to how and where you could use the colors.
    </p>

    <h1>White color</h1>
    <p>
      White is the blank canvas color that has all sorts of meanings to it. It's
      connected to cleanliness, virtue, purity, innocence... In North American
      cultures that is. In other parts of the world it can have an opposite
      meaning. White pairs great with basically any color on the spectrum. It
      has high contrast with pretty much all other colors and allows other
      colors to shine through, so it's a great choice for background colors.

    <p>
      Purple thinks it's better than all the other peasant colors. Lol, jk ;)
      Purple just has a history of being the color of superiority, being used by
      royalty to flaunt their position & power. It's associated with power,
      nobility, prestige & luxury. Purple can fall on both the warm and the cool
      side of the color wheel depending on how much red vs blue is added.

      <h3>Red</h3>
      <p>
        Red is a very emotionally & visually intense color that can actually
        have a physical effect on people by raising their metabolism,
        respiration, heart rate, as well as making them hungry. That combined by
        with the fact that red is very attention grabbing, you see red used in
        the branding of pretty much all fast food chains.

      <h3>Blue</h3>
      <p>
        Blue is a very calming color and can actually slow your metabolism
        (notice how there's little to no food brands that use blue in their
        branding). It's a broadly appealing color, which is why global companies
        like Facebook & Twitter use it for their logos. Although it is a broadly
        appealing color, it tends to be favored by men, with over 50% of men
        studied saying blue was their favorite color.

    <div class="card bg-grey">
      <h3>Tone</h3>
      <p>
        A tone is in between a tint and a shade. Basically you're adding grey,
        aka both white & black, to your hue.
